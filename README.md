### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Southampton.
- ðŸ”­ I used to work for Huawei as a software engineer for about 4 years (2019.08 - 2023.05). I used Huawei's internal git system during my time at Huawei, so I don't have much code on github. But I plan to gradually add code to github in the future!
